# RpG Celdas

## 1. Game Dynamics

The game is a turn-based RPG card game where we play against Celtic gods. We will have 4 cards to use, which will be renewed each time we use them. We need to defeat the god by making their health drop below 0 before they deplete our health (the player's).

There are 3 levels of gods we must defeat, progressing through each one. If we reach level 3 and win, we win the game. If we run out of health before defeating the god, we lose the game.

## 2D Core

We have created 4 scenes:

- **Main Scene**: where the game will take place.
- **Initial Scene**: where we can click "Start Game".
- **Winning Scene**: final scene indicating we have won.
- **Losing Scene**: final scene indicating we have lost.
